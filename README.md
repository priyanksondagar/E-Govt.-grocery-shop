<p> Just because of the procedure they are following like first consumer come to the owner and than owner ask for the family member and based
on this number of the family member they start preparing thr kit. Due to this whole procedure other consumers have to wait until theire's turn comes.

<h4> Here is a solution </h4>
<p> What if, the consumer tell the owner at the time of going to get the grocery. Owner get this information before consumer reach to the shop, so 
they can start preparing the kit and when consumer reach to the shop they just have to verify and give the kit. That's it .....</p>
